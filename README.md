Hello, I am James Sastamoine.

I studied at the University of Nebraska, Omaha and completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I am always looking for new ways to expand my IT career and education with many side projects. In the past couple of years, I have built my own custom NAS
that I use to also host a couple of VMs for automation scripts and video game servers. I also have dabbled in using Unity to learn a bit of game development
where I was creating a simple game called Block Runner. A simple concept to get the block from point A to point B without dying or falling off the edge.

I am hoping to add some of my code to hopefully show some of my competence and build a better reputation for myself.
